### OSFriend 

OSFriend lets you control your system using your voice.

It records audio with push-to-talk, transcribes speech using OpenAI, converts the request into a structured terminal command through an LLM, and executes it automatically on your system.

Speak a command → AI interprets → terminal executes. Currently supports Ubuntu.

Just set your api on the .env file and run the main.ts script.
